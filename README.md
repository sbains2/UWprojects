### (social_network.py and social_network_tests.py)
## CS 160 Homework 5:

Implementing network/friend recommendation algorithms:

social network and social network tests implements two mechanisms for recommending a new friend in a social network,
where the question is posed:

“For user X, who is the best person to recommend to them as a friend?”

Which actually answers a more comprehensive question:

“For user X, list some non-friends in order, starting with the best friend recommendation and ending with the worst.”

A non-friend is a user who is not X and is not a current friend of X. Depending on the recommendation algorithm, the list may include all non-friends of X or only some of them.

### blur_image.py and color_to_gray.py
## CS 160 Homework 3:

This project is designed to take input images and apply a blur effect to them. The code uses an algorithm that examines each pixel in the image and calculates the average value for that pixel. The resulting blurred image is then stored in a new grid with the same dimensions as the original image. For any pixel on the edge of the image, where its surrounding 8 pixels fall outside of the image, the code substitutes those values with 0. The end result is a blurred version of the original image that can be easily read and understood through individual pixels.
