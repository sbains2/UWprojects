CS 160 Homework 5:

Implementing network/friend recommendation algorithms:

social network and social network tests implements two mechanisms for recommending a new friend in a social network,
where the question is posed:

“For user X, who is the best person to recommend to them as a friend?”

Which actually answers a more comprehensive question:

“For user X, list some non-friends in order, starting with the best friend recommendation and ending with the worst.”

A non-friend is a user who is not X and is not a current friend of X. Depending on the recommendation algorithm, the list may include all non-friends of X or only some of them.
