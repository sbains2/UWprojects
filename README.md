### (social_network.py and social_network_tests.py)
## CS 160 Homework 5:

This project implement network/friend recommendation algorithms for a social network. The primary goal is to answer the question, "Who is the best person to recommend as a friend for user X?" by generating a list of non-friends ordered from best friend recommendation to worst. A non-friend refers to any user who is not X and is not currently a friend of X. The recommendation algorithm may include all non-friends or only a subset of them depending on the specific algorithm being used. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for social network friend recommendations.

### blur_image.py and color_to_gray.py
## CS 160 Homework 3:

This project is designed to take input images and apply a blur effect to them. The code uses an algorithm that examines each pixel in the image and calculates the average value for that pixel. The resulting blurred image is then stored in a new grid with the same dimensions as the original image. For any pixel on the edge of the image, where its surrounding 8 pixels fall outside of the image, the code substitutes those values with 0. The end result is a blurred version of the original image that can be easily read and understood through individual pixels.
